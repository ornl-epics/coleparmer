# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

ASYN=/home/controls/epics/asyn/master
AUTOSAVE=/home/controls/epics/autosave/master
STREAMDEVICE=/home/controls/epics/StreamDevice/master
BUSY=/home/controls/epics/busy/master
CP_RS232=/home/controls/epics/coleparmer/master

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE=     /home/controls/prod/epics/base/rel3.14.12.6_20170606

# These allow developers to override the RELEASE variable settings
# without having to modify the configure/RELEASE file itself.
